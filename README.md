# 🔊 AutoReadAloud

**AutoReadAloud** is a Python-powered voice automation bot that reads selected text aloud and feeds it into the system microphone using virtual audio routing. This helps automate browser-based **Read Aloud** tasks (like Moodle LMS or Viva assessments), where you normally need to speak out loud.

Instead of you talking, the bot does the talking for you — and the browser thinks it's your voice.

---

## 🎯 Use Case

> Select paragraph → Bot speaks it → Virtual mic feeds it → Browser records it.

Best for:
- ✅ LMS Read Aloud activities
- ✅ Online viva tests
- ✅ Duolingo and speech-based quizzes
- ✅ Any browser app that asks you to "speak"

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. 🖱️ You select and copy the paragraph.
2. 📋 Bot reads your clipboard.
3. 🗣️ Converts the text into natural voice using `edge-tts`.
4. 🔁 Audio is played through a **virtual speaker (VB-Cable Input)**.
5. 🎤 That audio is fed into a **virtual mic (VB-Cable Output)**.
6. 🌐 Browser records it as if you're reading it aloud.
